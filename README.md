# HospitalSecurityPlan
This is a personal summer project used to pratice some security design and skills.
Through this github I will be adding different security diagrams and tables.
Through this project I will be adding a list of these I have added in this readME seens below.

Currently the hospital project is split into 3 different areas:
	Main: 
		This is the typical hospital setting for appointments and medical needs.
		This is where people go for appointments and emergancies. Addtionally,
		this includes the staff that help schedule the appointments.
	Prescriptions:
		This is the area where people go to pick up the medicides that
		have been prescribed to them. Additionally these staff have 
		access to the changes prescriptions and address errors.
	Office:
		These staff have access to the medical information as well. Specfically
		for insurance reasons. These staff mostly deal with insurance and other
		administative jobs and responsibilities.
